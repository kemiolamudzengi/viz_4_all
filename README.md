## Welcome ooooo
This is the landing page for all the files we have used this week. 

## Closing Words
To keep on building your knowledge here are some next steps
Wow, as mentioned, in 3 days (roughly 5 hours) you were exposed to content that typically takes students months to learn. Wow. 
So what is next
Don’t stop here. Now that you know the “language” of viz, keep using it so you don’t lose it
Learn more about the theoretical underpinnings of VIZ. There are many research studies that explore the dance between visual perception and cognition.

## Next Steps
Now that I know Altair, what’s next
In Python, you can explore similar libraries like Seaborn
In JavaScript
 - Learn Vega, the JavaScript superset on which Altair is built
 - Learn D3.js, the JavaScript superset on which Vega is built
Now if you feel you still don’t know Altair, work through the textbook created by the creators of Altair. https://idl.uw.edu/visualization-curriculum/altair_introduction.html

It has additional examples.
Note that this book is not updated and uses Altair v.4 and not v.5. For updated examples consult the Altair API
